       Valentineâ€™s Day, also called St. Valentineâ€™s Day, holiday (February 14) when lovers express their affection with greetings and gifts........<br> Given their similarities, it has been suggested that the holiday has origins in the Roman festival of Lupercalia, held in mid-February.<br> The festival, which celebrated the coming of spring, included fertility rites and the pairing off of women with men by lottery. <br>At the end of the 5th century, Pope Gelasius I forbid the celebration of Lupercalia and is sometimes attributed with <br> replacing  it with St. Valentineâ€™s Day, but the true origin of the holiday is vague at best.<br> Valentineâ€™s Day did not come to be celebrated <br> as a day of romance until about the <br> 14th century.
